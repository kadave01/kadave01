### 🔬 About Me

My research centers on experimental work for next-generation combustor design, with a strong emphasis on energy transition in aviation. I have developed novel, low-cost diagnostic techniques for combustion and spray analysis. In parallel, I pursue the development of low-fidelity analytical and mathematical models to support early-stage design space exploration.

I strongly believe in the philosophy of open-source science and actively support it by using and promoting open-source tools in my research. This includes leveraging Python libraries like <strong>Cantera</strong> for chemical reactor network (CRN) analysis in combustion studies and <strong>OpenCV</strong> for digital image processing in droplet diagnostics—enabling accessible, transparent, and reproducible workflows in experimental combustion research.
