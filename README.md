## üë§ About Me

I am a research-engineer specializing in sustainable energy systems, with a strong background in experimental combustion and spray diagnostics. My work integrates lab-scale experiments with analytical modeling to advance development of technological solutions for the energy transition in the power and propulsion sector.

## üî¨ Research Interests

My research centers on experimental work for next-generation combustor design, with a strong emphasis on introducing H<sub>2</sub> to the energy mix in aviation. I have developed novel, low-cost diagnostic techniques for combustion and spray analysis. In parallel, I pursue the development of low-fidelity analytical and mathematical models to aid in early-stage design space exploration.

I strongly believe in the philosophy of open-source science and actively support it by using and promoting open-source tools in my research. This includes leveraging Python libraries like <strong>Cantera</strong> for chemical reactor network (CRN) analysis in combustion studies and <strong>OpenCV</strong> for digital image processing in droplet diagnostics‚Äîenabling accessible, transparent, and reproducible workflows in experimental combustion research.

## üíº Experience

- **TU Delft**, *Netherlands* ‚Äì PhD Candidate (Oct 2022 ‚Äì Present)  
  Doctoral research mainly focuses on experimental development of a multi-phase, multi-fuel (kerosene-H<sub>2</sub>) combustor alongwith CRN based analysis of the changes in the combustion chemistry and pollutant formation due to addition of H<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, I also work on development of a novel spray diagnostic technique that could potentially provide quantitative 2D spray characterization at much lowered cost. 

- **TU Delft**, *Netherlands* ‚Äì Researcher (Dec 2020 ‚Äì Spet 2022)  
  Worked on CH<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub> low-emission combustor development as part of the APPU project. Other responsibilities included supervision of MSc theses and designing the experimental facility for the project.

- **Feedback Infra Pvt. Ltd.**, *India* ‚Äì Design Engineer (Jul 2015 ‚Äì Jul 2018)  
  Worked on power plant optimization, technical feasibility studies, and proposal development for utility-scale energy infrastructure projects in India, Indonesia and Africa.
